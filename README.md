Goal of the assignment is to create a minimalistic product inventory system.
This repository contains a stub of the application with the same tech stack
that our real application is built with:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Node Express]
- [Ant Design UI library](https://ant.design/)

## Run the application
